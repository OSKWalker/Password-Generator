# Project Description

The objective of this project is to modify starter code with unique JavaScript code to create a clean, polished, and responsive application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected.

Based on the following criteria:
>The user should be able to...
>> - initiate a series of prompts to select the password criteria by clicking the generate button.
>
>> - choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters when prompted.
>
>> - select any combination of lowercase or uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters
>
>> - receive input validation and be informed that at least one character type must be selected.
>
>> - receive a generated password that matches their selected criteria and have it displayed as an alert or in the text box provided.

I feel that the most difficult part of this project was figuring out how to deal with the data sets and inputs while also trying to practice keeping my code D.R.Y. (Don't Repeat Yourself). I was able to minimize some of the repetition through the creative use of functions and methods. I still think there's plenty of room for improvement, but overall I'm pleased with the outcome.
